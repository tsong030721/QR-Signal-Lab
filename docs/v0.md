V0 builds the foundation for our lab. It will take available raw data and organize and clean it into something I can query, sanity-check, and compute exploratory features on.

1. Data Ingestion Layer
Pull historical data from a fixed source and store it in a consistent, raw format.

2. Cleaning + Structuring
Take raw data and produce a tidy, schema-consistent dataset. 

3. Access
A personal "query API" with useful functions for further data analysis
