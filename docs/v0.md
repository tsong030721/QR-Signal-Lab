V0 builds the foundation for our lab. It will take available raw data and organize and clean it into something I can query, sanity-check, and compute exploratory features on.

1. Data Ingestion Layer
Pull historical data from a fixed source and store it in a consistent, raw format.

Starting off with Yahoo Finance; tracking:
    - Crude Oil, Gold, Natural Gas, Corn, Copper

YFinance gives for each ticker
    - Adj Close, High, Low, Open, Close, Volume for specified date range with several omitted dates

Raw data stored as: data/raw/{ticker}.parquet

EXECUTION: from root. python3 -m qr_signal_lab.ingestion.run_ingestion.py -v -vv

2. Cleaning + Structuring
Take raw data and produce a tidy, schema-consistent dataset. 

3. Access
A personal "query API" with useful functions for further data analysis
