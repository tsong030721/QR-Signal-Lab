QR Signal Labs is a modular research environment built to replicate the infrastructure used by professional quantitative researchers.

- Initially focused on commodity futures
    - Exhibit clearer economic structure and more interpretable microfeatures than equity
    - Models the beginnings of the quant industry

V0 -> V4. Each layer hardens a specific layer of research pipeline.
    - Data ingestion & cleaning
    - Feature engineering
    - Signal construction
    - Backtesting
    - Multi-asset research

Build your own personal research platform and playground
    - Test hypotheses from papers and blogs
    - Test my own ideas
    - Generate real, interpretable results

3 PILLARS
1. Infrastructure
    - Clean ingestion, unified schema, leakage-free returns, reproducibility
2. Extensibility
    - Adding new features should not require rewiring of earlier layers
3. Interpretability
    - The true goal is to understand market structure
